ClosedCube Arduino Library for
ClosedCube HDC2080 Low-Power Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor
===========================================================================

These are ClosedCube breakout boards for Texas Instruments HDC2080 Low-Power Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor.

**Features:**

- Relative humidity range: 0% to 100%
- Humidity accuracy:±2% (typical), ±3% (maximum)
- Temperature accuracy:±0.2°C (typical), ±0.4°C(maximum)
- Sleep mode current:50 nA (typical), 100 nA(maximum)
- Operating temperature range: –40°C to 85°C
- Supply voltage range: 1.62V to 3.6 V
- I2C address^ either 0x40 or 0x41

^ - B023_HDC2080_DF13 board has populated with 4-Way DIP switch that allows to change I2C address and turn off/on pull-up resistors if more than one sensor board required on the same I2C bus.

**Manufacturer Part No:**

- B023_HDC2080_DF13 (DF13 Series boards)
- B023_HDC2080_PH (PH Series boards)
- B023_HDC2080_1MM (1mm Series boards)

**Requirements:**

- ClosedCube I2C Driver (Wrapper) https://github.com/closedcube/ClosedCube_I2C_Arduino
